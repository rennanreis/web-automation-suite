An end-to-end test automation suite for the [Sauce Labs Demo Site](https://www.saucedemo.com/) using Playwright and TypeScript.  
This project demonstrates modern QA practices including isolated test files, clear scenario coverage, and a roadmap for progressive refactoring using the Page Object Model, fixtures, and structured reporting.
