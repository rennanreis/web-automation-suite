An end-to-end test automation suite for the [Sauce Labs Demo Site](https://www.saucedemo.com/) using Playwright and TypeScript.  
This project demonstrates modern QA practices including isolated test files, clear scenario coverage, and a roadmap for progressive refactoring using the Page Object Model, fixtures, and structured reporting.

## Covered Test Scenarios

- **Login:** Valid credentials login flow
- **Product Search & Sorting:** Sorting products by price and name (A-Z, Z-A, low-high, high-low)
- **Cart:** Adding a product to the cart and validating the cart badge
- **Checkout:** Completing the checkout with valid information
- **Order Confirmation:** Validating the confirmation message and returning to the products page

## Project Highlights

- Applies the Page Object Model to keep UI interactions organized and easier to maintain.
- Each test file focuses on a real user scenario (login, sorting, cart, checkout, confirmation).
- All code is written in TypeScript for better readability and type safety.
- Uses Conventional Commits for a clear and understandable commit history.
- English comments are included throughout the code to help with understanding and future maintenance.
- The project is structured to make it easier to add new features and improvements as my learning progresses.

## Roadmap & Next Steps

- âœ… Refactored all tests to use the Page Object Model
- âœ… Improved code comments and documentation
- âœ… Covered main user flows: login, sorting, cart, checkout, confirmation
- ðŸ”„ Add reusable fixtures for setup and teardown
- âž• Expand test coverage with negative and edge case scenarios
- ðŸ“š Add more documentation and usage examples
- ðŸ”§ Integrate reporting and CI pipeline
